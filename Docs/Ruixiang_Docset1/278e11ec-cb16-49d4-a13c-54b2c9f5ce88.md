# Apply Filter

*Apply a filter such as IIR, moving average, and FIR to columns of a dataset*

Category: [Data Transformation\Filter](529B4991-8A7F-4E12-8F36-51F9FACA4383)


## Module Overview
[!INCLUDE[M_ApplyFilter](Token\M_ApplyFilter.md)] returns a dataset in which the selected columns have been transformed by the specified filter.


## Technical Notes

### Filter Periods
When you apply a filter to a column, note that the filter period is determined in part by the filter type,as follows:


-   For Finite Impulse Response, Simple Moving Average, and Triangular Moving Average filters, the filter period is **finite**.

-   For Infinite Impulse Response, Exponential Moving Average, and Cumulative Moving Average filters, the filter period is **infinite**.

-   For Threshold filters, the filter period is always **1**.

-   For Median filters, regardless of the filter period, NaNs and missing values in the input signal do not produce new NaNs in output.


### How Missing Values are Handled
If a filter encounters a NaN or a missing value in the input dataset, the output dataset becomes spoiled with NaNs for some next number of samples, depending on the filter period. This has the following consequences:


-   Filters created using Finite Impulse Response, Simple Moving Average, or Triangular Moving Average have a finite period; thus, any missing value will be followed by a number of NaNs equal to the filter order minus one.

-   Filters created using Infinite Impulse Response, Exponential Moving Average, or Cumulative Moving Average have an infinite period; thus, after the first missing value is encountered, NaNs will continue to propogate indefinitely.

-   Because the period of the Threshold filter equals 1, missing values and NaNs do not propagate.

-   For Median filters, NaNs and missing values encountered in the input dataset do not produce new NaNs in output, regardless of the filter period.
